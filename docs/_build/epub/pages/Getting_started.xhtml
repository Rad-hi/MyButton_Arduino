<h1>Getting started with <strong>MyButton</strong> library</h1>
<p>MyButton was originally created to make interacting with push-buttons easier for makers of interactive embedded projects. Down the line, it was extended with a second library <strong>MyCountingButton</strong>, which is dedicated for counting presses and interactions that are linked with counting presses in general.</p>
<p>If you have a project that has push-botton(s) in it, or are thinking of one, and would like to make the interactions with this project a bit more polished and complex, whilst not having to deal with the problems that arise from working with push-buttons, such as bouncing, then MyButton was made for you!</p>

<h3>1.2. Direct download/import:</h3>
<img alt="How to install through a direct download (ZIP)." src="../_images/download.png" style="width: 640px;" />
<p>Click on <strong>Download ZIP</strong> to download the library, place the unzipped folder into your libraries folder in your <strong>arduinosketchfolder/libraries/PUT_HERE**(on Windows, this is likely to be under **Documents/Arduino/libraries</strong>, on linux this is under <strong>home/Arduino/libraries</strong>). You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Now, restart the IDE.</p>
